# Computer science where to go guide for dummies üó∫Ô∏è
here we will look into different branches and fields within computer science. it will include several roadmaps like web-dev, android and ios dev,etc.
feel free to contribute to the project through pull requests.

**WEB-DEVELOPMENT**
<br>
so concisely there are basically two main parts modern web develeopment can be classified into: client side (frontend) and server side (backend).so lets briefly talk about what are they and what technologies are they comprised of. <br> <br>
CLIENT-SIDE: refers to everything in a web application that is displayed or takes place on the client (end user device). This includes what the user sees, such as text, images, and the rest of the UI, along with any actions that an application performs within the user's browser. <br>
SERVER-SIDE: development, sometimes called back-end development, is a type of development that involves programs that run on a server. This type of programming is important because web browsers, or clients, interact with web servers to retrieve information.
<br>
**clientside**
<br>
they are basically made up of html,css and javascript and some libraries and frmaeworksd like reactjs, angular,vuejs,etc.
<br>
**serverside**
<br>
those who are already proficient in javascript can go with nodejs which has fabulous framework of expressjs that can handle your CRUD operations.<br>
for others you have various tech stacks like for:
<br>
**php** you have **laravel** <br>
**python** you have **django** <br>
**java** you have **springboot** <br>
**ruby** you have **rails** etc..

**ANDROID DEVELOPMENT**
<br>
so basically if you want to become a android dev then there are are basically two to three languages and frameworks which all will lead you to the same destination, let us discuss them briefly<br>
**java** is one the most popular languages in the planet and is not in vain it can handle oyur web and android dev as well.<br>
**java** with **android studio**
**kotlin** with **android studio**
**react native**

**HOW TO START ANDROID DEV**
if you have selected the language of your choice then you can get started:
<br>
. Android App Components
- Gain knowledge of the different components that make up an Android app, such as activities, services, broadcast receivers, and content providers.
- Understand how these components interact with each other to create a cohesive app experience.

. User Interface (UI) Design
- Learn about XML layout files and how to create visually appealing user interfaces.
- Explore different UI design patterns and best practises for creating intuitive and user-friendly apps.

. Data Storage and Management
- Understand various data storage options available in Android, such as SharedPreferences, SQLite databases, and cloud-based solutions.
- Learn how to efficiently manage and retrieve data from these storage options.

. Networking and APIs
- Explore how to integrate network requests and APIs into your app.
- Learn about popular networking libraries like Retrofit and Volley to simplify the process of making HTTP requests.

. Security and Permissions
- Understand the importance of securing user data and implementing proper authentication mechanisms.
- Learn how to handle app permissions and ensure user privacy.

. Testing and Debugging
- Gain knowledge of different testing methodologies, such as unit testing and UI testing.
- Learn how to use debugging tools and techniques to identify and fix issues in your app.

. Publishing and Distribution
- Familiarize yourself with the process of publishing your app on the Google Play Store.
